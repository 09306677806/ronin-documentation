# Welcome to Ronin

Ronin is a blockchain built by Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity. It supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols so that developers are able to build high-performance, feature-rich blockchain projects. Ronin was specifically customized to be a long term scaling solution for Axie Infinity, meaning it’s optimized to enable virality and to provide global access to the blockchain gaming revolution. These aspects make Ronin a natural fit for collectibles, art, and, of course, gaming. 

Ronin means “a samurai without a master,” and this idea mirrors the motivation behind Ronin Network’s creation: a desire to take our product’s destiny into our own hands. 


Currently, the Ronin mainnet uses a Proof-of-Authority (POA) consensus algorithm. At the bootstrap of the network, carefully selected, trusted validators were predefined to secure the network. After that, validators can be added or removed if the decision is approved by the majority of currently active validators.

We are migrating Ronin consensus using Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA), a combination of Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and PoA, to increase the level of decentralization and allows the token holders to join the network as validators. DPoS is a more democratic way of choosing who verifies the next block since it’s based on earned reputation as a lawful staker and not overall wealth. This allows for a more diverse group of people to participate in the process.


### What is a Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where nodes collectively execute a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.


### Proof-of-Authority
Proof-of-authority is a consensus algorithm that delivers an efficient solution for blockchains, specifically private ones. The term was coined in 2017 by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. 
In proof-of-authority, machines earn the right to generate new blocks by passing a strict vetting process, which is discussed in detail in the next section. As a  result, trustworthy validation machines protect PoA blockchains. These system moderators are preapproved participants who check blocks and transactions.

### Delegated-Proof-of-Stake

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm that is a variation of the classic Proof of Stake (PoS) system. DPoS evolved from PoS and allows users of the network to vote in delegates who then validate blocks.

### Proof-of-Staked-Authority

Proof-of-Staked-Authority is a combination between Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and PoA. Token holders use their stake to vote and elect the validator set. Then, Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner.
