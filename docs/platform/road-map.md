# Road Map

**Migrating to Proof of Stake (POA) consensus**
* Currently, Ronin blockchain uses proof of authority (POA) consensus, which means that the set of validators are predefined in the bootstrap of the blockchain and will be updated if the majority of validators agrees to add/remove some node. Although this consensus mechanism is highly secure, it reduces the decentralized level and makes it more difficult to scale because new validators need to be approved by the majority of current validators.

* Our plan is to move to a more decentralized consensus (like dPOS) in 2022. Some layer-2 solutions such as rollups, sidechains are being researched by our core team, which will enhance the performance and scalability of the blockchain significantly in the future.

**Adding on-chain utilities**
* We will also add useful applications of off-chain games to falicitate on-chain game development on Ronin. For example, many games need a “truly” random value generation for selecting recipients of rewards. These data will be provided through reliable oracles connecting to the Ronin blockchain.
