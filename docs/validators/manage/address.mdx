## Overview

This guide describes how to change your admin address, which is the address you use to manage your profile and staking activities, and to claim self-staking rewards.

Key points:

* You will not receive self-staking rewards on the day when you change the admin address, but you will still earn your commission as normal.
* Your self-staking rewards will be sent to the new address starting the next day.
* Any unclaimed rewards from your old admin address will remain there, and you can claim them at any time by logging in with the old admin address.

## Change your admin address {#admin}

1. Open the Validator Dashboard, then go to your account, and then click **My profile**.
   <img src={profile} width={280} />

2. In the **Admin Address** field, click the edit icon.
   <img src={changeStepOne} width={400} />

3. Paste your new admin address.
   <img src={changeStepTwo} width={400} />

4. Save the changes.

There's a cooldown period of 24 hours after changing the admin address. That means you will not able to modify the admin address again until 24 hours after the last change.
