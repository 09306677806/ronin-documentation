When signing up as a validator on Ronin, you were asked to set a commission rate, which is the percentage of the block reward
you receive before distributing the rest to your delegators.

You can change this commission rate in your profile.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
your account > **Commission rate**.

2. Enter the new commission rate in the range of 0-20%,
and set the date when it takes effect. This date must be at least seven days from now.

After saving the new, a clock icon will appear next to your
current rate, informing users of the upcoming change.
