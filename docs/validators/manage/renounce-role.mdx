If you're a Standard Validator or Validator Candidate, 
follow this guide to renounce your validator role. If youâ€™re a Governing Validator, contact Sky Mavis for instructions.

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then select your account, and then click **Renounce**.

is permanent and cannot be undone.

3. Click **Renounce** to submit the request.

After submitting the request, wait seven days for the renunciation to take effect. To avoid slashing, keep your node online and up to date during this period.
Your commission, bridge rewards, staking rewards, and the remaining
self-stake will be transferred to you on the date of renunciation.
